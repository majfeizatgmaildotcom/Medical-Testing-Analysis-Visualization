From Majid Feiz, Bayesian-Inference-Application in Medical Testing
Consider two people, Joe and Jim, who went to cancer screening at different clinics, Joe for prostate 
cancer screening and Jim for breast cancer screening. Male breast cancer is rare (“less than 1% of all 
breast cancers occur in men”, https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/male_bc), but prostate 
cancer is common (“About 6 cases in 10 are diagnosed in men who are 65 or older”, 
https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html). Both heard that their cancer
screenings turned out positive. In this exercise, assume P (Cancer=Male_breast) = 0.01 and P
(Cancer=Male_prostate) = 0.6. Also assumed TPR and TNR for prostate cancer screening are 0.75 and 
0.70 and TPR and TNR for breast cancer screening are 0.85 and 0.80, respectively.
Developed a contingency table for Bayesian inferencing for each individual.
